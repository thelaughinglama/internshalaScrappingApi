# InternshalaScrappingApi
<h3>The Need?</h3>
Just going through all the available internships on internshala under the domain you selected can get tedious when the no. of available internships are high in number.As a web developer finding internships which were in compliant with my tech stack was getting very difficult. To give you an idea, last time I searched for web development internships there were more than 300 available internships but only 13 internships which  were compliant with my stipend expectations and  my tech stack.Since it was taking too much time i decided to make this api.The task which used to take 3+ hours and infinite mouse clicks took like 20 min and 13 mouse clicks.
